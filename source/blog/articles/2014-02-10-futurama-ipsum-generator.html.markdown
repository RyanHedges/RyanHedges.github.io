This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! It may comfort
you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so
intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying,
it caused him to empty his bowels. OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. I
suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… You are the last hope of
the universe.

For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who
liked lilacs! I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the
known universe! Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. Well,
then good news! It's a suppository. Bender?! You stole the atom. Fry, we have
a crate to deliver.

Say what?
Say what?
It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long,
the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off
his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper
died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of
this getting through to you?
Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? Yeah, lots of
people did. Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are
pretending to be. Then we'll go with that data file! Fry, we have a crate to
deliver.

You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all
are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours
of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused. Bender, hurry! This
fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying!

Well, then good news! It's a suppository.
Can we have Bender Burgers again?
I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Say what? Can we
have Bender Burgers again? Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg
'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! Oh sure! Blame the wizards!

Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. It doesn't
look so shiny to me. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Good man. Nixon's
pro-war and pro-family.

Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he
pledged not to go on a killing spree. Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Perhaps, but
perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above
you!

File not found. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for
a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you
sexually? Really?! Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Oh yeah, good luck
with that.

Your best is an idiot! THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW
I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! It's just like the story of the grasshopper
and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for
winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then
the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns.
Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? Good news,
everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! Oh, I don't have
time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and
then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. Hey, you add a
one and two zeros to that or we walk!

You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! We can't compete with Mom! Her
company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! You know the worst thing
about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you
go.
