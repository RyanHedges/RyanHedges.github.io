middleman templates are the scaffolding to a project -
  blog is a template I'm using. It gives boilerplate that's needed
  for a porject.

source directory is considered "/" or root of the directory. Any
  directory created can be referenced by "/nameof/directory.rb"
  where "nameof" is the directory in soure, and then the file.

Partials go directly in the source dir and have underscore in front
  The take `:locals => {:name => "of", :variables => "as symboles"}

`git -u` is upstream and makes it tells git that you will be doing
  `git pull` from that branch. 

There are gems for middleman and then there are gems for middleman blog
  that middleman init --template=blog gives you.
