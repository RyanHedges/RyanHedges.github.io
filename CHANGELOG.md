## ChangeLog

The following are the changes that are made to my site over time. I am keeping
this as a record for when I implement new features or fix weird bugs. I do
not plan on using this to record when I make blog posts, only changes to the
code itself.

  - About, projects, and contact pages are available.
  - website is mobile friendly for all content.

#### 1.0.0
